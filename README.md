# Project

Travel Blog project:

Bulma framework used. 

Basic elements (use of JSON file, localstorage and weather fetched from OpenWeatherAPI)

Bonus elements:
- User can delete cards and elements from the New Entries list. 
- User can use EditPage to update some styling aspects of the edit page itself (not applicable to the rest of the pages). Multiple error encountered. Example: it just applies the changes of the first element on the Styles List, and when the page reloads the changes are lost (though the new list of styles remains, since it's saved into local storage).
- Map with markers on travel locations (using fetched info from the JSON file)
